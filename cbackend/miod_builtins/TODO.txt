!!! - autorelease pool for functions that construct instances? !!!
- think over inc/dec ref rules
- finish gen_enum.py

+ generics is emulated only with class/interface names containing argument types names,
    no need to support in runtime. Compiler-side only. First implementation will
    generate only one class/interface description for all generic variants. So wrong
    casting is possilbe, one should check returned class/interface directly.
+ add runtime generic types to instance to allow safe upcasting form Object to Some$<a,b>
    - implement via embedding into class name
+ research scripts to generate C code structures
    + use java + StringTemplate
+ weak references
- string, int, float etc. wrapper classes
    + string (basic implementation)
    + int
- optional value class
    - empty
    - value
- enums
    - enum = interface + static class instances  OR like in Rust -- union with tag?

- properties
- metadata (runtime annotations)
- abi stability (backwards compatibility with older binaries for dylibs)
